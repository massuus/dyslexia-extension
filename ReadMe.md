## üîß Developer notes

* **No keys in source:** `secret.js` is git-ignored.
* **Fonts:** `OpenDyslexic-Regular.woff2` and `LexendDeca-VariableFont.woff2`
  are shipped inside `/assets/fonts` and referenced with `chrome.runtime.getURL`.
* **Manifest v3** ‚Äî background-less; everything runs in the content script.
* **Caching layers:**

  1. **Map** in the current tab (fastest)
  2. **IndexedDB** (`defs` store, compound key `[word, sentence]`)
  3. **OpenAI** API call (last resort)
